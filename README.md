# Introduction to Data Visualization 2019 Spring: Project

This is my IDV data visualization project, aimed to visualize the differences between the election poll numbers in British parliamentary elections. If I have time, I might try to use the same viz-magic for Finnish elections too.

## Prerequisites

You have to have Python >= 3.5 and pip installed.

## TODO

* Add the current major party in parliament to the poll-date time-series as background colors
* Perhaps add some major political events to the data as points on the lines
* See if there is a direct correlation between being in government vs in opposition, and how much it affects ratings
* See if the trend for the party election results can be estimated from the poll data, and if so how much before the elections it can be done accurately?
* Try to find the reasons for any abnormal behaviour in the data, eg during 1997-2001, 1988-1995
